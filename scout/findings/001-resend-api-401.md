## Resend email integration returning 401 Unauthorized

**What:** The Resend API integration is failing with HTTP 401 on every health check cycle (every 5 minutes). This means all transactional emails are broken — email verification, password resets, team invitations, rescan alerts, etc. Users who sign up cannot verify their email.

**Where:** Fly.io logs for app `mcplens`, health monitoring integration check

**Evidence:**
```
2026/03/24 19:56:31 WARN health: integration unhealthy integration=resend error="resend API returned status 401"
```
This appears on every health check cycle (19:48:02, 19:53:03, 19:56:31).

**Regression note (2026-03-24 20:40):** Builder marked as `done` but the Fly.io logs at 20:37:32 still show `resend API returned status 401`. The deployment image has not changed (still version 25, image `mcplens:deployment-01KMFWB4CXAR5RY66G1KTBDWW1`). The fix was not deployed or did not take effect.

**Why this matters:** MCPLens is a SaaS product that requires user signup to access paid tiers (Pro, Max, Agency). Without working email, the entire signup funnel is broken — users can't verify their accounts, can't reset passwords, and can't receive rescan alerts. This directly blocks revenue. Every minute this stays broken, potential paying customers are bouncing off a dead signup flow. It also means existing users who forget passwords are locked out with no recovery path.

**Suggested Fix:** The `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable on Fly.io is either missing, expired, or invalid. Steps:
1. Check the key: `flyctl secrets list -a mcplens` — verify `RESEND_API_KEY` exists
2. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys and generate a new key (or verify the existing one)
3. Update: `flyctl secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxx -a mcplens`
4. The app will auto-restart and the health check should pass
